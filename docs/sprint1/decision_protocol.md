Decision Protocol




All of us in group 1 have been properly acquainted and have not had any major decision 
making conflicts so far.

Right away we talked about meeting in real life at school to work on sprints occasionally
at least to make a better work environment for us all. We believe it will be important 
for the coming challenges we are faced with as a group.

At our first meeting we decided to meet every week on thursdays at 14:20 because the whole 
group should be able to show up at that time. We decided this after Sara (our TA) 
talked about doing that with her group when she went through the course and she said 
it made communication clearer and easier within the group.

We also talked about meeting two times a week but we deemed it unnecessary for the
first sprint at least and decided to discuss that again when we see the workload for 
future sprints.

We have split up work for sprint 1 to each group member, if this decision turns out to be unfair
to some members due to one having a bigger workload for instance that will be addressed in the 
second sprint meeting.

After or during the second sprint meeting we will come together to finish our report
with everyone's finished work together and discuss our results.

We as a group maintain good communications on the discord channel the course
has provided. This shows we are all moving together towards the same goal of doing well 
in this course and maybe not have a terrible time while doing so.
