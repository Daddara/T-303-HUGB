Meeting 2 (7.10.2021)

Time 14:20

Attending: All members attending

Went over the distribution of tasks. Discussed how we would change all the wrapper functions that use the Staff class to make them use the Doctor or Nurse class. We will first change the staff class to call the doctor or nurse class, instead of deleting the staff class, in order to prevent errors. Later we will remove the staff class all together.
Next meeting planned for thursday at 10:00.

Time 10:20

Attending: All members attending

Discussed how we are going to divide the review parts between us. Decided that we will have a doc file where we can see what and how other members in our team have reviewed what code, in order to prevent going over the same code, and keeping the style and methods the same between members.
