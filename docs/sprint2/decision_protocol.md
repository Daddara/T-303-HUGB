Decision Protocol


SPRINT 2

Scrum Master: Arnar

Meeting 1 (9.9.2021)

Who showed up: Arnar, Rúnar, Tryggvi, Hörður, Daníel

Others did not attend the meeting because of work/scheduling issues. 

A simple python program picked a scrum maser. 

We decided that we should make a temporary interface to work by until we get an interface from the client. 

We decided that the top 7 user stories we have should be distributed/assigned to the 7 group members. 

Use cases for this sprint:

#11 As a nurse, I want to be able to see all information about a patient, so I can know about previous medical history, or any medical issues.

#16 As a receptionist, I want to be able to add a new patient to the system, so that he can be treated at the hospital

#13 As a doctor, I want to be able to see all patients that have an appointment with me for a specified day so that I can properly prepare.

#15 As a doctor, I want to be able to see all patients that have an appointment with me for a specified date period so that I can properly prepare.

#19 As a receptionist, I want to be able to a delete a patient, so the system is not full of patients that will not be patients at the hospital again.

#25 As a receptionist, I want to be able to a delete a patient, so the system is not full of patients that will not be patients at the hospital again.

#28 As a specialist, I want to be able to see all patients assigned to me, so I can properly prepare.

Code: 
We decided to use Snake Case as the style of programming. Definition of done: Once the user stories all run and work correctly in the mock interface, we can declare the sprint as done.

Meeting 3 (14.09.2021)
time 16:30
scrum master: Arnar
secretary:Rúnar

Who showed up: Arnar, Ingunn, Tryggvi, Hörður, Daníel

Scrum master Arnar takes status report on group members.

We decide to put up a test file similar to the one from a previous lecture.

We talk about having all the branches up to date to avoid merge conflicts.

Meeting 4 (16.09.2021)
time 16:30
scrum master: Arnar
secretary:Rúnar
Attending: All group members

We talk about different code practices that is better for group work. For instance make seperate py files and import them when making new classes instead of writing everything in one file everyone at once.

Might need to change some things in the code to seperate to files.

Test file is online and group members should be able to get it from git.

Group members help each other with git issues.

Meeting 5 (20.09.2021)
time 14:00
scrum master: Arnar
secretary:Rúnar
Attending: All group members

We talk about the structure of the code and how to start implementing things for those who have not pushed code yet.
The class skeleton is not fully constructed and might be a slight delay in implementing specific methods. 
This meeting is in person so we use whiteboards in the school to explain how the classes are connected.
We finalize what classes whe want in sprint2.
